### Week 1:
Assignment 1: Starting first assignment with intention in learning how to code in Rust and Python. As someone who has never coded in these two popular languages,
this is a perfect opportunity to learn how the languages work.

Jan 17, 2023: Successfully implemented a wavetable oscillator based off of https://thewolfsound.com/sound-synthesis/wavetable-synth-in-rust/. Can take inputs of MIDI notes into an array and plays them alongside an array of how long to play each note

### Week 2:

Assignment 1: Added MIDI functionallity and CSound functionality.
